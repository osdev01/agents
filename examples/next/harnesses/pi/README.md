# Pi harness

An experimental example that runs pi's durable `AgentHarness` inside a plain
Durable Object, composed from the SDK's Lifecycle capabilities. Nothing here is
exported from the `agents` package yet; `PiHarness` and the Workers AI provider
live in this example's `src/` and pin an unreleased pi build.

The example composes:

- `PiHarness extends LifecycleCapability` for the durable agent loop;
- `Tasks` to drive each conversation lane to settlement and replay after
  eviction;
- `Streams` to durably record every operation's live output;
- `WebSockets` to serve that output to the browser;
- `agents/skills` for a bundled `trip-planning` skill;
- pi-ai's Workers AI provider, transported over the `AI` binding.

Pi owns the transcript, tool intents and results, retries, and recovery. The
SDK supplies durable wakes, the output log, and the client transport.

## Run locally

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```

The example uses the remote Workers AI binding and may incur Workers AI usage.
It needs no API key. If your Wrangler login has access to more than one
account, set `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` when starting.

## What to try

- `Roll four 12-sided dice and total them.`
- `Use the calculator to multiply 47 by 19.`
- `Remember that my favourite launch snack is stroopwafels.`
- `What did I tell you my favourite launch snack was?`
- `I want to plan a trip.` activates the bundled skill.

Tool calls and results render live as they happen. Reload the page mid-turn
and the transcript and in-flight reply resume from the durable stream. Use the
new-session button to start with a fresh Durable Object.

## Test

```sh
pnpm test
```

The test runs a real Durable Object with pi-ai's faux provider, drives a tool
call to settlement, evicts the object, and checks the transcript and a second
turn survive.

## Core pattern

```ts
export class PiAgent extends DurableObject<Env> {
  readonly tasks = new Tasks();
  readonly streams = new Streams();

  readonly harness = new PiHarness({
    models: createModels({ providers: [workersAI(this.env.AI)] }),
    model: { provider: "cloudflare-workers-ai", modelId: MODEL_ID },
    tasks: this.tasks,
    streams: this.streams,
    tools: () => tools
  });

  readonly webSockets = new WebSockets(this.harness.webSockets());

  readonly lifecycle = Lifecycle.install(this)
    .use(this.tasks)
    .use(this.streams)
    .use(this.webSockets)
    .use(this.harness);
}
```

Each lane's work runs as one `Tasks` run whose replayable step drives pi to
settlement. Every operation's events land in one `Streams` stream, and
`harness.webSockets()` returns the options for a `WebSockets` capability that
serves a small JSON protocol: a lane snapshot on connect, `subscribe` to
replay-then-tail an operation's stream from a client cursor, and `submit`,
`abort`, and `steer` to drive it. The browser connects with `useAgent` from
`agents/react`; `src/use-pi-session.ts` layers the protocol on that socket.
