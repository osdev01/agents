# AGENTS.md — packages/agents

The core Agents SDK, published to npm as `agents`. This is the most complex package in the monorepo.

## Package exports

Each export maps to a public entry point that users `import` from. These are the boundaries of the public API — changes here need a changeset.

| Import path                   | Source file(s)                | Purpose                                                                      |

## Build

```bash
pnpm run build          # runs tsx scripts/build.ts
```

Uses **tsdown** (ESM-only, with .d.ts generation and sourcemaps). Build entry points are explicitly listed in `scripts/build.ts` — if you add a new export, add it there too.

After build, `oxfmt --write` formats the generated `.d.ts` files.

The `check:exports` script at the repo root verifies that every `exports` entry in `package.json` has a corresponding file in `dist/`.

## Testing

> Repo-wide coverage rollup (feature × layer, CI→layer mapping, skip debt):
> [`../../design/test-coverage-matrix.md`](../../design/test-coverage-matrix.md).

Multiple separate test suites, each with its own vitest config:

### Workers tests (`src/tests/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:workers   # or: pnpm exec vitest -r src/tests
```

Runs inside the Workers runtime via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`. Uses a `wrangler.jsonc` to configure Durable Object bindings, queues, workflows, etc. Tests cover: state, scheduling, sub-agent routing, callable methods, WebSocket message handling, email routing, MCP protocol, workflows.

### Lifecycle and capability tests (`src/tests/lifecycle/`, `src/tests/capabilities/`)

Part of the shared workers project — there is no separate Lifecycle vitest
project or wrangler config. `src/tests/lifecycle/` holds one test file per
Lifecycle functionality: runtime handlers, startup (including failure retry),
alarm arbitration, capability events, capability routing, host context,
hibernating WebSockets, identity, and disposal. Capability contract tests
mirror their source module (`src/tests/schedules/capability.test.ts`,
`src/tests/mcp/client-capability.test.ts`) and drive real harness Durable
Objects defined one-per-capability in `src/tests/capabilities/` — see
`src/tests/capabilities/AGENTS.md` for the pattern.

### React tests (`src/react-tests/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:react     # or: pnpm exec vitest -r src/react-tests
```

Runs in **Playwright (Chromium, headless)** via `vitest-browser-react`. A global setup script starts a miniflare worker on port 18787. Tests cover: `useAgent` hook, cache invalidation, cache TTL, state sync.

### Voice tests (`src/voice/tests/`, `src/voice/react-tests/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:voice:workers
pnpm run test:voice:react
```

The Worker project covers the server mixins, provider contracts, wire protocol,
and eviction behavior. The browser project covers the React hooks.

### Channels tests (`src/channels/__tests__/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:channels
pnpm run test:channels:live # opt-in, requires provider credentials
```

The deterministic suite covers the core and provider adapters. Live delivery
checks are serial and stay outside the default test target.

### Node tests (`src/node-tests/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:node      # or: pnpm exec vitest --project node
```

Plain Node.js tests for package entry-point bundle isolation and the Vite skills
plugin.

### WebMCP tests (`src/webmcp-tests/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:webmcp    # or: vitest --project webmcp
```

Runs in **Playwright (Chromium, headless)** via `@vitest/browser-playwright`. Tests the experimental WebMCP adapter: tool discovery, registration, execution relay, watch mode (SSE re-sync), error handling, and edge cases.

### x402 tests (`src/x402-tests/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:x402     # or: pnpm exec vitest --project x402
```

Focused tests for the x402 payment / auth integration.

### Browser connector e2e tests (`src/browser-tests/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:browser   # or: vitest run --config src/browser-tests/vitest.config.ts
```

Spawns a real `wrangler dev` (local Browser Rendering simulator + worker
loader) and exercises the `BrowserConnector` end to end: CDP spec queries,
`browser_execute` runs, and session lifecycle modes (one-shot, dynamic
promotion, reuse + sweep, survive-a-pause, multi-socket probe). Kept out of
the default `test` target so CI's `nx affected -t test` doesn't require
Chromium — run it locally when touching `src/browser/`.

### Chat primitive tests (`src/chat/__tests__/`)

```bash
pnpm exec vitest --project chat
```

Low-level tests for shared chat primitives in `src/chat/` (turn queue,
resumable streams, sanitization, etc.). These back both
`@cloudflare/ai-chat` and `@cloudflare/think`.

### Type-level tests (`src/tests-d/`)

Files ending in `.test-d.ts`. These use `expectTypeOf` / `assertType` to verify TypeScript types at compile time. They're checked by the typecheck script, not by vitest directly.

### E2E tests (`src/e2e-tests/`)

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e       # or: pnpm exec vitest run -c src/e2e-tests/vitest.config.ts
```

End-to-end tests that start real workers and exercise managed-fiber and facet
recovery across process termination.

### Evals (`evals/`)

```bash
pnpm run evals          # runs evalite inside evals/
```

AI evaluation suite (scheduling accuracy, etc.). Requires API keys in `.env`.

## Key architecture notes

- **Agent directly extends `DurableObject` and composes `Lifecycle`** — the lifecycle installs request, alarm, and always-hibernating WebSocket entry points. Agent adds state sync, RPC, scheduling, SQL, MCP client, email, and workflows.
- **State sync is bidirectional** — `this.setState()` on the server broadcasts to all connected clients; `agent.setState()` from the client sends to the server. Both directions use the same message format (`MessageType.CF_AGENT_STATE`).
- **Client RPC is decorator-gated** — methods on Agent subclasses must use `@callable()` before clients can invoke them through `agent.call("methodName", args)` or `agent.stub.methodName(...)`. Serialization constraints are enforced by the `Serializable` type system (`src/serializable.ts`).
- **Sub-agents are facets** — `subAgent(Cls, name)` creates or resolves a child DO colocated on the same machine. Clients reach a child via `/agents/{parent}/{name}/sub/{child}/{name}` and `useAgent({ sub: [...] })`. Parents gate access with `onBeforeSubAgent`; children reach their parent with `parentAgent(Cls)` or `parentPath`.
- **Lifecycle owns the job queue and the physical alarm** — capabilities and the host push jobs (`capability` + `fn` + due time + payload) into the `cf_agents_jobs` table; Lifecycle drives due jobs as an alarm event loop with retry, deferral, and the memory-limit circuit breaker, and derives the physical alarm from queue state. Queue mutations re-arm automatically. Each capability keeps its own durable state rather than depending on Scheduler.
- **Scheduling uses cron-schedule** — `Scheduler` is the vocabulary over the job queue: it validates schedules, resolves named callbacks, and pushes jobs whose `fn` is the callback name. `Agent` installs the same primitive and delegates `this.schedule()` and related APIs to it. Schedules persist in SQLite and survive hibernation.
- **MCP has separate package boundaries** — `mcp/server/index.ts` is the Stateless Worker wrapper; `mcp/client/index.ts` connects Agents to external servers; `mcp/index.ts` is a compatibility barrel for retained Legacy APIs whose implementation lives in `mcp/server/legacy-agent.ts`.
- **Telemetry has an independent schema version** — `instrumentation_scope.version` is hardcoded to `"1"`; it is not the package version. Notify Workers Observability and any other downstream consumers before bumping it.

## Boundaries

- Every new public export needs: an entry in `package.json` `exports`, a build entry in `scripts/build.ts`, and a changeset
- `src/index.ts` is very large (~6000 lines) — be surgical with edits, understand the full context before changing
- `agents/chat` is published and versioned, but treat it as a sibling-package support layer first, not a broad user-facing surface. Prefer documenting `@cloudflare/ai-chat` / `@cloudflare/think` directly unless a primitive is intentionally shared.
- The lifecycle substrate is vendored under `src/lifecycle` and ISC-attributed. Keep `agents/lifecycle` small: no alternate WebSocket modes, speculative phases, or second Durable Object base class.
- Peer dependencies (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/*`, `react`, `zod`) are optional — guard usage with runtime checks or separate entry points
- Keep Voice and Channels out of `src/index.ts`; their explicit subpaths protect core imports from browser, React, provider, and MIME code
- Keep Channels adapters out of `src/channels/index.ts`; import internal Voice and chat helpers through relative paths rather than package self-imports
